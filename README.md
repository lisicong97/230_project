**Raiders of the Lost Ark**

We are going to design a game application called Raiders of the Lost Ark. In this game, the player would have an adventure on an island. The island is like a maze, which has complex roads and some dead ends. Playerâ€™s goal is to find as many treasures on the island as possible. The treasures can be generated at any random place as time goes by. There are some zombies in the maze who are wandering and guarding the treasures and they are also generated randomly. You will be killed once they catch up to you and then the game is over. The zombies are different in their speed and health. To protect yourself, you have a gun, which can shoot the zombies and kill them. There are different kinds of guns with different shoot speed and power.

For every round of the game, a random maze would be generated. The player can press arrow keys to control the character to move in four directions and press space to shoot the gun. Score is measured by the total number of treasures you have collected. Once you are touched by a zombie, the game is over. To make the game more interesting and consistable, Some special guns and some fruit would appear in the maze randomly. The fruit can increase the player's health. And the special gun would have an improvement to the speed and power of the origin gun.In order to finish our project, we will use some third party dependencies like Brick and Graphics. And zombies and players would be represented by a square. Treasures and fruits would be represented by a small square. The whole maze would be represented by line.
